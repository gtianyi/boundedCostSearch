Only one of these classes significantly relies on a metareasoning component. We explore the characteristics of this class of models and argue that it offers desirable properties. In fact, many of the effective approaches to bounded rationality that have been developed since the early 1980's match this particular paradigm. We conclude with some open research problems and challenges.},

abstract = {A planning problem is time-dependent, if the time spent planning affects the utility of the system's performance. In [Dean and Boddy, 1988], we define a framework for constructing solutions to time-dependent planning problems, called expectation-driven iterative refinement. In this paper, we analyze and solve a moderately complex time-dependent planning problem involving path planning for a mobile robot, as a way of exploring a methodology for applying expectation-driven iterative refinement. The fact that we construct a solution to the proposed problem without appealing to luck or extraordinary inspiration provides evidence that expectation-driven iterative refinement is an appropriate framework for solving time-dependent planning problems.},

abstract = {Anytime algorithms offer a tradeoff between solution quality and computation time that has proved useful in applying artificial intelligence techniques to time-critical problems. To exploit this tradeoff, a system must be able to determine the best time to stop deliberation and act on the currently available solution. If there is uncertainty about how much solution quality will improve with computation time, or about how the problem state may change after the start of the algorithm, monitoring the algorithm's progress and/or the problem state can make possible a better stopping decision and so improve the utility of the system. This paper analyzes the issues involved in run-time monitoring of anytime algorithms. It reviews previous work and casts the problem in a new framework from which some improved monitoring strategies emerge.},
